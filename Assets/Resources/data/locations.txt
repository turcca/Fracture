DATASTART																																							
1c01	New Dirae	The Cradle of the Furies	New Dirae is the capital of the Cradle of the Furies subsector, but it has seen better days. Originally the Furia homeworld before their retreat during the Great Crusade, New Dirae is all about desperately clinging to past glories.	When the Furia left New Dirae, they expected to be back. Most of their old infrastructure, palaces and monuments are still intact. Some have been repurposed, some made into museums and some remain as forbidding ruins to past hubris. Rumors say that there are still undiscovered marvels of ancient technology in those ruins. Ship scanners hint at sprawling planetary structures deep underground.

1c02	The Arch	The Cradle of the Furies	The origins of the Arch are a mystery. It's a vast, only partially inhabited space station of archaic design, a haunting repository of ancient technology nobody understands anymore. Its very existence hints to a purpose far grander than what it is today.	An analysis of the construction style and technology of the Arch suggests a strong connection to the old Furia who lived on New Dirae. Its strcture implies that the Arch was originally built for the purpose of terraforming and interstellar travel, although it also seems older than almost anything in the sector.

1c03	Megaera	The Cradle of the Furies	Originally a Furia colony, Megaera has done better in the wake of the Great Crusade than many other worlds. Many of its resources were taken over by House Rathmund in acrimonious disputes after the end of the war.	Its true that most of the land and other essential assets on the planet are held in trust by the Megaera Planetary Fund, but the MPF is in turn controlled by an interstellar organization. Its assets have long since been passed on to other Rathmund interests, a fact made obvious by all the Rathmund construction on MPF land.

1c04	Alecto	The Cradle of the Furies	Alecto used to be a core world of the old Furia, but it fell hard in the aftermath of the Great Crusade. It was the first to surrender to Imperium forces after heavy orbital bombardment that leveled the planetary infrastructure. Within two generations, outside contact to the surface was lost. The people of Alecto now live around the cumbling carcasses of old Furia technology, small plots of farmland nested between the ruins.	The people of Alecto like to moan about their fall from grace, but in truth the planet has never been important. In the days of the Furia, it was a secondary agricultural world. Perhaps because of this desperate desire to mimic past glories that were never real, Alecto's society has remained like a snapshot of what the old Furia was like before the Great Crusade.

1c05	Tisiphone	The Cradle of the Furies	The site of one of the hardest battles of the Great Crusade, Tisiphone was bombarded heavily from orbit. The massive craters covering its surface can still be seen clearly. Rumor has it that since the Crusade, the Imperium has fostered conflict on the planet to keep it on its knees.	Tisiphone's inhabitants have made salvage into an industry, cutting up old crashed warships and selling the materials for scrap. The planet's vast scrapyards are a treasure trove of rusting, abandoned technology, as long as you have the eye to separate junk from bizarre ancient machines of destruction.

1c06	Creon	The Cradle of the Furies	Creon was originally settled by the Furia for agricultural purposes, but hasn't managed to maintain spaceflight capability after they left. An unpleasant planet known for its fungus farms and labor disputes, few people have any reason to visit Creon.	After visiting Creon a few times, some oddities of local culture become obvious. The people seem to deviate from the basic human genotype more than usual, and are very uniform in appearance. The local holidays emphasize a struggle of liberation against the Furia, and greatly resemble some of the practices of the Everlasting Union.

1c07	Beyond the Horizon	The Cradle of the Furies	The failures of Beyond the Horizon as an inhabited world are overshadowed by the fact that it hosts House Valeria's Guiding Council. The planet is an economic nightmare, and many of its struggling citizens spend all their money to educate their children so they might have a future on a Valeria starship.	Beyond the Horizon is essentially a caste society of a vast population of destitute workers supporting the beautiful dreams of the Valeria. House Valeria has traditionally been progressive in its values, but its focus is in space, not in its back yard. There are repeated social experiments implemented by the Valeria, all with the common idea of doing nothing to change the planet's economic structure.

1c08	The Garden of Augustus	The Cradle of the Furies	Apparently called the Garden of Augustus in old Furia records, the planet is not on Imperial star maps. Scanners indicate a verdant, habitable world with signs of human settlement. There is a standard space station silently orbiting the planet. Analysis of radio traffic emanating from the planet suggests its been deliberately obfuscated to make it harder to detect.	The Furia will rise again! Not the House Furia known all across the sector today, but the old Furia, the Furia of New Dirae. Strangely, the inhabitants of the Garden of Augustus lack many of the physical characteristics common to the Furia of today. The local culture seems to be a strange archaic version of modern Furia practices.	Hiding	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.008		0.02	0.08	0.1	0.09	0.1	0.28	0	0.03	0.02	0.02	0.26	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	2	1	1	17	1
1c09	The Mortuary	The Cradle of the Furies	The tomb world of the Mortuary hold monuments to the glorious dead of the old Furia, before they had to evacuate from the subsector. The planet's current inhabitants are the descendants of those the Furia settled here to tend to their graves.	Graverobbing is the main reason offworlders come to the Mortuary. There are rumors of strange technology hidden inside the pyramids. Ancient members of House Furia are said to be held in suspended animation deep underground, waiting for the day when the House will rise again.

2v01	New Luna	The Sovereign Void	The Sovereign Void's subsector capital of New Luna is a large moon orbiting a gas giant. It has benefited greatly from the economic boom brought by the Great Crusade, and features a vigorous industry that feeds off the gas giant nearby. The planet is independent and densely populated, and the wares sold on its famous media markets reach the farthest corners of the sector.	New Luna's culture industry was a sore point with the planet's relationship with the Imperium. The Church has expressed a repeated desire to control and direct New Luna's media output, but so far the planet has resisted, and the Imperial government has allowed it to do so now with the Disconnect to the Imperium, and because of the immense economic power of New Luna.

2v02	The Essence of Discovery	The Sovereign Void	A popular tourist destination for the sector's super-rich, The Essence of Discovery is a pleasant, rustic world of natural wonders and beautiful landscapes. Many Valeria captains retire there after successful careers.	The inhabitants serving the visitors and retirees of the Essence of Discovery are noticeably attractive. Its rumored this is because of longstanding Valeria gene policies and immigration restrictions. Beauty is a Valeria ideal, but for the servants and workers of the Essence of Discovery, its just another requirement imposed on them.

2v03	Keziah	The Sovereign Void	Keziah is best known for the impressive ability of its locals to credit their success to their genetic and cultural superiority. The world escaped the violence of the Great Crusade and all subsequent conflicts largely unscathed, leaving it in a good position to profit when others are rebuilding their ravaged homes.	The famous Keziah arrogance is not entirely unwarranted, just misplaced. The planet's peace and prosperity can be credited to its successful diplomats and keen eye for when to switch sides in any given conflict. For Keziah, food is a weapon: as a major agricultural producer, it can plunge a planet into a famine simply by suddenly redirecting its shipments.

2v04	Concord	The Sovereign Void	A space station even older than human habitation in the sector, Concord is famous as the place of many peace negotiations. It's known as neutral ground, and a haven for ships travelling though.	There are plenty of negotiations on Concord, and some of them might even be fair, but whoever loses, House Rathmund always seems to win. Indeed, Rathmund influence on the station stems from an old settlement granting them its use in exchange for services as mediators.

2v05	New Carthage	The Sovereign Void	A world of forbidding mountains, raging oceans and vertical, densely populated cities, New Carthage is known for its political intrigues and ruthless economic policy. Sector's nobility are often seen there, and the planet is a popular destination for migrants who believe its promise of riches through hard work.	The open secret of New Carthage is that the planet is a host of the Dacei Family, and houses its Meritorious Directorate, the governing body of the Family. Dacei involvement on the planet is a mixed blessing: it has bolstered New Carthage's trade, but also suppressed its lower classes through its economic policies.

2v06	The Blessing of Peace	The Sovereign Void	The Blessing of Peace was originally colonized by House Rathmund, but as a result of its open immigration policies, its inhabitants have diverse interests. The planet is not an easy place to live. Many new citizens trying to make it between the electric storms and corporate ravages have bitterly regretted their choice to move there.	The Blessing of Peace is the only planet with House Rathmund operating in the open. It hosts the House's Five Families, which together form its top leadership. There's irony in the fact that the planet is both the only honest Rathmund effort to run a colony and its only real failure. Its held together only by a steady stream of immigrant labor and money.

2v07	Ascalon	The Sovereign Void	A planet of oceans, islands and glaciers, Ascalon houses vast seaweed farms and a number of Church monasteries and retreats. Visiting these places as anything other than a pilgrim or a supplicant is almost impossible, as the Church makes sure outsiders rarely get a glimpse of what happens inside.	There's a reason why the Church doesn't want outsiders snooping around on Ascalon. Its monasteries and retreats are home to a lot of strange research concerning the Fracture, and not all of it conforms to official doctrine. Some of these holy experiemnts are conducted in Ascalon's prison settlements for those who have broken holy law.

2v08	Durendal	The Sovereign Void	Durendal is a failed agricultural world that was supposed to have been a twin of Ascalon in the Church's quest to bring faith and devotion to the sector. Its inhabitants still cling to their past as devoted servants of the Church and the Imperium, but the truth is that Durendal is obscure in its insignificance.	There's something sad in Durendal's loyalty to the Church and the Imperium. In truth, it began as a mining colony, quickly stripmined of its resources to facilitate the construction of more important Church worlds. Once the Church got everything it wanted from it, it left Durendal to its own devices.	Connected	0	0.02	0	0	0	0.06	0	0.1	0		0.36	0	0	0	0.05	0.28	0	0.22	0	0	0.09	1.4	0.9	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	59	0
2v09	Immanence	The Sovereign Void	A rocky, geologically unstable planet, the first records of Immanence's name are from a survey ship passing the planet during the Great Crusade. From orbit, it seems that there are widespread tunnels and underground spaces underneath the planet's surface. Scanner signatures suggest these might be inhabited.	There is something strange about the inhabitants of Immanence. Their rituals and practices make the planet feel like a Church world, but its unlikely a Church emissary would recognize any of them. There are massive Fracture engines built directly into the crust of the planet for unknown purposes.	Hiding	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.54		0	0.14	0.07	0	0.09	0.17	0	0	0.02	0.01	0.5	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	3	2	2	78	3
3f01	The Fall of the Dacei	The Crusader's Folly	Actually named The Glory of the Dacei, but nobody calls it that. The planet represents an early victory for the Dacei, awarding the Family exclusive trading rights in exchange for moving a lot of business there, and even granting the Family naming rights. Since then, the planet has proven to be an eternal source of woe, hit with a crisis after crisis. The planet represents the first and last time the Family made a highly visible power play in the sector.

3f02	Tranquillity	The Crusader's Folly	A space station built out of the first fleet of the Great Crusade trying to cross the Folly. The remnant fleet was tied together into a forward base that bridged the gap into the Seat of Mercury. Tranquillity is technically part of the Imperium's transport infrastructure, but in practice it's controlled by House Rathmund who utilizes the transfer point for its volume of cargo, diplomats, politicians and other people who're not currently in favor but might have a use later on.

The Great Crusade reached the world after a grueling battle against the Furia, helping the planet to obtain very favorable terms for its inclusion in the Imperium.

Since then, the planet has adopted an isolationist policy and focused on a number of internal land wars that have consumed its resources and despoiled its environment. Planetary elites are debating re-establishing contact with the Imperium as their economy starts to struggle.

5e04	New Megaera	The Martyr's Expanse	While Renovatio Dirae is the administrative center of House Furia, many of its most prominent members live on the planet New Megaera, famed for its natural beauty. Most of the planet's inhabitants live in tightly controlled slums to ensure that much of the planet remains an untouched wilderness suitable for Furia hunting expeditions.

5e05	Chiron	The Martyr's Expanse	A colony built by religious refugees from the Imperium after the initial decades of colonization in the sector, Chiron was known for its repressive religious practices, bordering on heresy even after the planet joined the Imperium in the wake of the Great Crusade. Shortly before the Disjunction, the planet was ravaged by an epidemic resulting in a quarantine. The epidemic is long gone, but the planet has yet to re-establish contact.

5e06	Charis	The Martyr's Expanse	The original colony destroyed as the Imperium designated the planet as a prison world after the Great Crusade, people on Charis have long harbored a deep distrust of the Imperium. Either descendants of prisoners or the original, mistreated colonists, the planet's citizens have maintained a policy of isolation long enough for it to be largely forgotten. Even the Imperial prisons were closed a long time ago.	TODO	Hiding	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0		0	0	0.07	0	0.1	0.48	0	0	0.07	0.06	0.22	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	2	1	1	229	1
5e07	Elysium	The Martyr's Expanse	A prosperous planet hiding from the Imperium, Elysium's colonization predates even the arrival of the Furia in the sector. It was terraformed by one of the early seed ships to leave the Earth and settled by colonizers who had spent an eternity in cryosleep. Elysium's inhabitants have little experience with Fracture technology and represent an antique human genotype.

5e08	Arete	The Martyr's Expanse	The Imperial warship Spear of Longinus crashed onto Arete in the last days of the Great Crusade. Arete was barely habitable at the time, and the Imperium failed to locate its missing ship. The stranded warship's crew formed the planet's initial settlers, striving st first to regain spaceflight capability but then building lives outside the reach of the Imperium. The planet's culture is a strange look back in time to how things were at the time of the Crusade.

5e09	Andromache	The Martyr's Expanse	An early independently settled colony, Andromache's only spaceflight capability is from a series of antique shuttles. It has never officially joined the Imperium and maintains a strong nationalist rhetoric, made possible by the fact that Imperial officials use it as a tax haven to hide corruption windfall.

6t01	Bounty of Peace	The Terminus Sea	Until recently a world in perpetual crisis, Bounty of Peace now playes host to the Coruna Cartel's head office. The Cartel is strong on the planet after investing heavily in local industry. The Cartel has exercised its power by renaming the planet to reflect the idea that trade brings peace, although in truth the Cartel's acquisition spree has been fuelled by assassination and bribery.

6t02	Eos	The Terminus Sea	An ocean planet with only minimal land area, the agriculture on Eos is largely based around seaweed. Settled as part of a Valeria marine research program, the planet has developed an independent population living in fleets of perpetually mobile ships. The planet has kept contact with the Imperium at minimum following a disastrous pogrom conducted by the Church shortly before the Disjunction.

6t03	The Terminus	The Terminus Sea	A barely habitable world, The Terminus was colonized in the aftermath of the Great Crusade to ensure that the Imperium's reach encompasses the entire sector. Famous for its underground farms and eternal ice storms, the planet's distance from the sector administrative center has allowed it to develop and prosper largely without interference.

6t04	Catena	The Terminus Sea	The most populated planet on the subsector, Catena is home to significant anti-Imperium sentiment. Locals blame the Imperium's taxes for the sorry state of their economy, and the planet has stopped all communications to the rest of the sector in a bid to establish its independence. A project to build a fleet to fight the Imperium's forces places further drain on the planet's resources.	TODO	Hiding	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.14		0	0	0	0	0	0.42	0	0	0	0	0.58	1	0.9	1	1	1	1	1	1	2	1	1	251	1
6t05	Antares	The Terminus Sea	Populated by colonizers carried by a seed ship operated by the Rathmund predecessors the Void Syndicate, left to drift in the Fracture and emerging here centuries later. The population deviates significantly from the basic human genotype, and for this reason has kept a low profile on the sector.

7i01	Model Colony No. 2	Interior Structure	Second in the series of model colonies created by the Everlasting Union, No. 2 is the most successful.

7i02	Asterion	Interior Structure	Asterion was a failed and abandoned Furia colony until some 60 years ago it was settled by the Everlasting Union in secret. An experimental world was created outside Union's Model Colony program, the goal with Asterion has been to promote industrial specialization through radical changes in what a human is. Controversial within the Union because of the way individuals have been harnessed to the goal of industrial production in a manner that echoes the old cruelties of the Furia, Asterion has nevertheless been a success in terms of production output.

7i03	Far Shore	Interior Structure	A religious colony created by a monastic Church group, Far Shore has experienced a lot of turbulence in its half a century of existence. The original idea of creating a new type of human who wouldn't live in temptation of the Fracture was complicated by the many Fracture incursions the planet has experienced. A recent revolution among the colonists has deposed the original religious order ruling it, and the inhabitants have a strong desire to rejoin the Imperium, if only they could.

7i04	Eternal Victory	Interior Structure	The very last planet to fall to the Great Crusade, Eternal Victory is the site of a preposterous monument financed by the Tarquinia and built using prisoners of war. It's a vast obsidian pyramid topped by a white pillar of light visible from orbit. Eternal Victory's bad location and the drain on resources of constructing the pyramid have crippled the local economy, and the presence of so many Tarquinia nobles has not helped. Locals belong to three categories: loyal citizens include nobility and those working for them. They live in the cities. Neutral citizens work the fields and the mines in near destitution. Disloyal citizens are held in prison camps or sent to the mountains, and starve in large quantities.

7i05	Melancholia	Interior Structure	Settled by refugees escaping the Great Crusade, Melancholia's original population is a strange mismatch of Imperial mutineers, Furia dissidents, and civilians who just wish to get away. The planet is not very hospitable to human life, requiring protective suits from all who venture outside during daylight. Because of its history, the planet trades with the Imperium only secretly, wishing to avoid being taken into the fold by force.

7i06	Eden	Interior Structure	While Eschaton is supposed to represent the perfection of the Church's vision for humanity, there's also another faction which holds a more peaceful and rural existence as ideal. Eden has been built along those lines: it's settlements are small and there are no real cities. When the planet was terraformed, a great premium was placed on bucolic landscapes. Unfortunately, thanks to unfavorable Fracture currents and local issues with space transportation, the planet has lost contact with the Imperium. Alone, its economy fails, so there's a strong desire to get back in the fold.	TODO	Lost	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.55	0.008		0.4	0	0	0	0	0.12	0.07	0.2	0	0.07	0.14	0.9	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	38	0
7i07	Model Colony No. 3	Interior Structure	A part of the Everlasting Union's Model Colony project, No. 3 experienced extreme social unrest for most of its initial years. Experimental ideas concerning cloning and competition rendered it the site of a number of territorial wars between first-generation clones. The Colony has lost contact with the Imperium, and whether it wants to rejoin depends on who of the many factions is being asked.

7i08	New Earth	Interior Structure	The Heretic capital and former minor Churchy colony, New Earth has been so named because it's supposed to be the new cradle of humanity where people will one day spread thorough the galaxy and the Fracture in equal measure.
