DATASTART																																							
1c01	New Dirae	The Cradle of the Furies	New Dirae is the capital of the Cradle of the Furies subsector, but it has seen better days. Originally the Furia homeworld before their retreat during the Great Crusade, New Dirae is all about desperately clinging to past glories.	When the Furia left New Dirae, they expected to be back. Most of their old infrastructure, palaces and monuments are still intact. Some have been repurposed, some made into museums and some remain as forbidding ruins to past hubris. Rumors say that there are still undiscovered marvels of ancient technology in those ruins. Ship scanners hint at sprawling planetary structures deep underground.

1c02	The Arch	The Cradle of the Furies	The origins of the Arch are a mystery. It's a vast, only partially inhabited space station of archaic design, a haunting repository of ancient technology nobody understands anymore. Its very existence hints to a purpose far grander than what it is today.	An analysis of the construction style and technology of the Arch suggests a strong connection to the old Furia who lived on New Dirae. Its strcture implies that the Arch was originally built for the purpose of terraforming and interstellar travel, although it also seems older than almost anything in the sector.

1c03	Megaera	The Cradle of the Furies	Originally a Furia colony, Megaera has done better in the wake of the Great Crusade than many other worlds. Many of its resources were taken over by House Rathmund in acrimonious disputes after the end of the war.	Its true that most of the land and other essential assets on the planet are held in trust by the Megaera Planetary Fund, but the MPF is in turn controlled by an interstellar organization. Its assets have long since been passed on to other Rathmund interests, a fact made obvious by all the Rathmund construction on MPF land.

1c04	Alecto	The Cradle of the Furies	How the mighty have fallen! Alecto used to be a core part of the old Furia, but it fell hard in the aftermath of the Great Crusade. It was the first to surrender to Imperium forces after heavy orbital bombardment that leveled the planetary infrastructure. Within two generations, outside contact to the surface was lost. The people of Alecto now live around the cumbling carcasses of old Furia technology, small plots of farmland nested between the ruins.	The people of Alecto like to moan about their fall from grace, but in truth the planet has never been important. In the days of the Furia, it was a secondary agricultural world. Perhaps because of this desperate desire to mimic past glories that were never real, Alecto's society has remained like a snapshot of what the old Furia was like before the Great Crusade.

1c05	Tisiphone	The Cradle of the Furies	The site of one of the hardest battles of the Great Crusade, Tisiphone was bombarded heavily from orbit. The massive craters covering its surface can still be seen clearly. Rumor has it that since the Crusade, the Imperium has fostered conflict on the planet to keep it on its knees.	Tisiphone's inhabitants have made salvage into an industry, cutting up old crashed warships and selling the materials for scrap. The planet's vast scrapyards are a treasure trove of rusting, abandoned technology, as long as you have the eye to separate junk from bizarre ancient machines of destruction.

1c06	Creon	The Cradle of the Furies	Creon was originally settled by the Furia for agricultural purposes, but hasn't managed to maintain spaceflight capability after they left. An unpleasant planet known for its fungus farms and labor disputes, few people have any reason to visit Creon.	After visiting Creon a few times, some oddities of local culture become obvious. The people seem to deviate from the basic human genotype more than usual, and are very uniform in appearance. The local holidays emphasize a struggle of liberation against the Furia, and greatly resemble some of the practices of the Everlasting Union.

1c07	Beyond the Horizon	The Cradle of the Furies	The failures of Beyond the Horizon as an inhabited world are overshadowed by the fact that it hosts House Valeria's Guiding Council. The planet is an economic nightmare, and many of its struggling citizens spend all their money to educate their children so they might have a future on a Valeria starship.	Beyond the Horizon is essentially a caste society of a vast population of destitute workers supporting the beautiful dreams of the Valeria. House Valeria has traditionally been progressive in its values, but its focus is in space, not in its back yard. There are repeated social experiments implemented by the Valeria, all with the common idea of doing nothing to change the planet's economic structure.

1c08	The Garden of Augustus	The Cradle of the Furies	Apparently called the Garden of Augustus in old Furia records, the planet is not on Imperial star maps. Scanners indicate a verdant, habitable world with signs of human settlement. There is a standard space station silently orbiting the planet. Analysis of radio traffic emanating from the planet suggests its been deliberately obfuscated to make it harder to detect.	The Furia will rise again! Not the House Furia known all across the sector today, but the old Furia, the Furia of New Dirae. Strangely, the inhabitants of the Garden of Augustus lack many of the physical characteristics common to the Furia of today. The local culture seems to be a strange archaic version of modern Furia practices.	Hiding	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01		0.02	0.08	0.1	0.09	0.1	0.28	0	0.03	0.02	0.02	0.26	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	2	1	1	17	1
1c09	The Mortuary	The Cradle of the Furies	The tomb world of the Mortuary hold monuments to the glorious dead of the old Furia, before they had to evacuate from the subsector. The planet's current inhabitants are the descendants of those the Furia settled here to tend to their graves.	Graverobbing is the main reason offworlders come to the Mortuary. There are rumors of strange technology hidden inside the pyramids. Ancient members of House Furia are said to be held in suspended animation deep underground, waiting for the day when the House will rise again.

2v01	New Luna	The Sovereign Void	The Sovereign Void's subsector capital of New Luna is a large moon orbiting a gas giant. It has benefited greatly from the economic boom brought by the Great Crusade, and features a vigorous industry that feeds off the gas giant nearby. The planet is independent and densely populated, and the wares sold on its famous media markets reach the farthest corners of the sector.	New Luna's culture industry was a sore point with the planet's relationship with the Imperium. The Church has expressed a repeated desire to control and direct New Luna's media output, but so far the planet has resisted, and the Imperial government has allowed it to do so now with the Disconnect to the Imperium, and because of the immense economic power of New Luna.

2v02	The Essence of Discovery	The Sovereign Void	A popular tourist destination for the sector's super-rich, The Essence of Discovery is a pleasant, rustic world of natural wonders and beautiful landscapes. Many Valeria captains retire there after successful careers.	The inhabitants serving the visitors and retirees of the Essence of Discovery are noticeably attractive. Its rumored this is because of longstanding Valeria gene policies and immigration restrictions. Beauty is a Valeria ideal, but for the servants and workers of the Essence of Discovery, its just another requirement imposed on them.

2v03	Keziah	The Sovereign Void	Keziah is best known for the impressive ability of its locals to credit their success to their genetic and cultural superiority. The world escaped the violence of the Great Crusade and all subsequent conflicts largely unscathed, leaving it in a good position to profit when others are rebuilding their ravaged homes.	The famous Keziah arrogance is not entirely unwarranted, just misplaced. The planet's peace and prosperity can be credited to its successful diplomats and keen eye for when to switch sides in any given conflict. For Keziah, food is a weapon: as a major agricultural producer, it can plunge a planet into a famine simply by suddenly redirecting its shipments.

2v04	Concord	The Sovereign Void	A space station even older than human habitation in the sector, Concord is famous as the place of many peace negotiations. It's known as neutral ground, and a haven for ships travelling though.	There are plenty of negotiations on Concord, and some of them might even be fair, but whoever loses, House Rathmund always seems to win. Indeed, Rathmund influence on the station stems from an old settlement granting them its use in exchange for services as mediators.

2v05	New Carthage	The Sovereign Void	A world of forbidding mountains, raging oceans and vertical, densely populated cities, New Carthage is known for its political intrigues and ruthless economic policy. Sector's nobility are often seen there, and the planet is a popular destination for migrants who believe its promise of riches through hard work.	The open secret of New Carthage is that the planet is a host of the Dacei Family, and houses its Meritorious Directorate, the governing body of the Family. Dacei involvement on the planet is a mixed blessing: it has bolstered New Carthage's trade, but also suppressed its lower classes through its economic policies.

2v06	The Blessing of Peace	The Sovereign Void	The Blessing of Peace was originally colonized by House Rathmund, but as a result of its open immigration policies, its inhabitants have diverse interests. The planet is not an easy place to live. Many new citizens trying to make it between the electric storms and corporate ravages have bitterly regretted their choice to move there.	The Blessing of Peace is the only planet with House Rathmund operating in the open. It hosts the House's Five Families, which together form its top leadership. There's irony in the fact that the planet is both the only honest Rathmund effort to run a colony and its only real failure. Its held together only by a steady stream of immigrant labor and money.

2v07	Ascalon	The Sovereign Void	A planet of oceans, islands and glaciers, Ascalon houses vast seaweed farms and a number of Church monasteries and retreats. Visiting these places as anything other than a pilgrim or a supplicant is almost impossible, as the Church makes sure outsiders rarely get a glimpse of what happens inside.	There's a reason why the Church doesn't want outsiders snooping around on Ascalon. Its monasteries and retreats are home to a lot of strange research concerning the Fracture, and not all of it conforms to official doctrine. Some of these holy experiemnts are conducted in Ascalon's prison settlements for those who have broken holy law.

2v08	Durendal	The Sovereign Void	Durendal is a failed agricultural world that was supposed to have been a twin of Ascalon in the Church's quest to bring faith and devotion to the sector. Its inhabitants still cling to their past as devoted servants of the Church and the Imperium, but the truth is that Durendal is obscure in its insignificance.	There's something sad in Durendal's loyalty to the Church and the Imperium. In truth, it began as a mining colony, quickly stripmined of its resources to facilitate the construction of more important Church worlds. Once the Church got everything it wanted from it, it left Durendal to its own devices.	Connected	0	0.02	0	0	0	0.06	0	0.1	0		0.36	0	0	0	0.05	0.28	0	0.22	0	0	0.09	1.4	0.9	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	59	0
2v09	Immanence	The Sovereign Void	A rocky, geologically unstable planet, the first records of Immanence's name are from a survey ship passing the planet during the Great Crusade. From orbit, it seems that there are widespread tunnels and underground spaces underneath the planet's surface. Scanner signatures suggest these might be inhabited.	There is something strange about the inhabitants of Immanence. Their rituals and practices make the planet feel like a Church world, but its unlikely a Church emissary would recognize any of them. There are massive Fracture engines built directly into the crust of the planet for unknown purposes.	Hiding	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.54		0	0.14	0.07	0	0.09	0.17	0	0	0.02	0.01	0.5	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	3	2	2	78	3
