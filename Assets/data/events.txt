@a security "There is a sizable fleet at the station. But even with large shipyards, there are nothing really fancy here."
@a quartermaster "This is one of the big worlds, the Old Capital itself is 300 million people. We can probably find specialists here."

@a navigator "Orion Bridge, Perseus Transit. Most Fracture Cores originally come from here. Even ours."
@a engineer "Nobody understands the Arch anymore, but there are the Caretakers who maintain it, and are responsible for the Beacon. When it broke a 100 years ago, we lost contact to the Imperium and were left here to our own devices."
@a security "You can find no better technology in the sector. If you have the money, you can fit anything to your ships in the Arch. The shipyards are huge and can even dock a Ship of the Line."
@a quartermaster "There are 300.000 people living on The Arch, which is more than any other space station can handle. Some of the best minds of the sector are here. There is a pull to it, gravitas. Can you feel it?"
@a psycher "You can't see the Caretakers on the station, they live in separated sections on the Arch. But I think I can feel them. I can feel someone, deep inside the Arch."
@a priest "The Blessed Arch. After the Caretakers failed at their task with the Beacon, the Church has been negotiating to share in the responsibility. It feels wrong to have these... these technicians handling this sacred task."

@a engineer "Magaera is a volcanic world pushing up minerals and energy for the factories. You can get pretty good trades in here, importing food and exporting industrial goods."
@a security "Small industrial world that doesn't build ships and arms. It needs to rely on the protection of a powerful faction. Maybe that was the intention?"

@a engineer "What they really need is education. However, many of these primitive worlds have descended from reason into superstition and it would take a real effort to make that happen."

@a quartermaster "You can find fierce warriors in these feral worlds. Hard conditions breed hard men. Should we get some?"
@a psycher "The scars run deep here, and not all have forgotten what was done to them. Few of them look up at the stars anymore. Not like they used to."
