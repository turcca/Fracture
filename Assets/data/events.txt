@a navigator "Orion Bridge, Perseus Transit. Most Fracture Cores originally come from here."
@a engineer "Nobody understands the Arch anymore, but there are the Caretakers who maintain it, and are responsible for the Beacon. When it broke a 100 years ago, we lost contact to the Imperium and were left here to our own devices."
@a security "You can find no better technology in the sector. If you have the money, you can fit anything to your ships in the Arch. It can dock even a Ship of the Line."
@a quartermaster "There are 300.000 people living in The Arch, which is more than any other space station can handle. Some of the best minds are here. There is a pull to it, can you feel it?"
@a psycher "You can't see the Caretakers on the station, they live in separated sections on the Arch. But I think I can feel them. Or someone, deep inside."

@a engineer "Magaera is a volcanic world pushing up minerals and energy for the factories. You can get pretty good trades in here, importing food and exporting industrial goods."
@a security "Small industrial world that doesn't build ships and arms. It needs to rely on the protection of a powerful faction. Maybe that was the intention?"

@a psycher "The scars run deep here, and not all have forgotten what was done to them. But few look up at the stars anymore. Not like they used to."
