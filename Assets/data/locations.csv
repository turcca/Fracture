1c01,New Dirae,The Cradle of the Furies,"New Dirae is the capital of the Cradle of the Furies subsector, but it has seen better days. Originally the Furia homeworld before their retreat during the Great Crusade, New Dirae is all about desperately clinging to past glories.","When the Furia left New Dirae, they expected to be back. Most of their old infrastructure, palaces and monuments are still intact. Some have been repurposed, some made into museums and some remain as forbidding ruins to past hubris. Rumors say that there are still undiscovered marvels of ancient technology in those ruins. Ship scanners hint at sprawling planetary structures deep underground.",connected,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0,,0.08,0.12,0.18,0,0.11,0,0.1,0.26,0.09,0.01,0.05,0.8,0.8,1,1.2,1.1,1,1,1,3,4,2,812,3
1c02,The Arch,The Cradle of the Furies,"The origins of the Arch are a mystery. It's a vast, only partially inhabited space station of archaic design, a haunting repository of ancient technology nobody understands anymore. Its very existence hints to a purpose far grander than what it is today.","An analysis of the construction style and technology of the Arch suggests a strong connection to the old Furia who lived on New Dirae. Its strcture implies that the Arch was originally built for the purpose of terraforming and interstellar travel, although it also seems older than almost anything in the sector.",connected,0,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0,,0.05,0.08,0.24,0.04,0.2,0,0.09,0.2,0.06,0.04,0,0.2,0.1,1,1.3,1,2,1.5,1.2,4,4,4,0.3,5
1c03,Megaera,The Cradle of the Furies,"Originally a Furia colony, Megaera has done better in the wake of the Great Crusade than many other worlds. Many of its resources were taken over by House Rathmund in acrimonious disputes after the end of the war.","Its true that most of the land and other essential assets on the planet are held in trust by the Megaera Planetary Fund, but the MPF is in turn controlled by an interstellar organization. Its assets have long since been passed on to other Rathmund interests, a fact made obvious by all the Rathmund construction on MPF land.",connected,0.01,0.58,0,0,0,0.01,0,0,0.01,,0.06,0.04,0.12,0,0.21,0.02,0.09,0.2,0.06,0.08,0.12,0.5,1.3,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,48,2
1c04,Alecto,The Cradle of the Furies,"How the mighty have fallen! Alecto used to be a core part of the old Furia, but it fell hard in the aftermath of the Great Crusade. It was the first to surrender to Imperium forces after heavy orbital bombardment that leveled the planetary infrastructure. Within two generations, outside contact to the surface was lost. The people of Alecto now live around the cumbling carcasses of old Furia technology, small plots of farmland nested between the ruins.","The people of Alecto like to moan about their fall from grace, but in truth the planet has never been important. In the days of the Furia, it was a secondary agricultural world. Perhaps because of this desperate desire to mimic past glories that were never real, Alecto's society has remained like a snapshot of what the old Furia was like before the Great Crusade.",connected,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06,0,,0.25,0,0,0,0.05,0.42,0,0.24,0,0,0.04,1.4,0.8,1,1,1,0.8,1,1,0,0,0,22,0

The massive craters covering its surface can still be seen clearly. Rumor has it that since the Crusade, the Imperium has fostered conflict on the planet to keep it on its knees.","Tisiphone's inhabitants have made salvage into an industry, cutting up old crashed warships and selling the materials for scrap.

An unpleasant planet known for its fungus farms and labor disputes, few people have any reason to visit Creon.","After visiting Creon a few times, some oddities of local culture become obvious. The people seem to deviate from the basic human genotype more than usual, and are very uniform in appearance.

1c07,Beyond the Horizon,The Cradle of the Furies,"The failures of Beyond the Horizon as an inhabited world are overshadowed by the fact that it hosts House Valeria's Guiding Council. The planet is an economic nightmare, and many of its struggling citizens spend all their money to educate their children so they might have a future on a Valeria starship.","Beyond the Horizon is essentially a caste society of a vast population of destitute workers supporting the beautiful dreams of the Valeria.

1c08,The Garden of Augustus,The Cradle of the Furies,"Apparently called the Garden of Augustus in old Furia records, the planet is not on Imperial star maps. Scanners indicate a verdant, habitable world with signs of human settlement. There is a standard space station silently orbiting the planet. Analysis of radio traffic emanating from the planet suggests its been deliberately obfuscated to make it harder to detect.","The Furia will rise again! Not the House Furia known all across the sector today, but the old Furia, the Furia of New Dirae. Strangely, the inhabitants of the Garden of Augustus lack many of the physical characteristics common to the Furia of today.

It has benefited greatly from the economic boom brought by the Great Crusade, and features a vigorous industry that feeds off the gas giant nearby. The planet is independent and densely populated, and the wares sold on its famous media markets reach the farthest corners of the sector.","New Luna's culture industry was a sore point with the planet's relationship with the Imperium.

Many Valeria captains retire there after successful careers.","The inhabitants serving the visitors and retirees of the Essence of Discovery are noticeably attractive.

The world escaped the violence of the Great Crusade and all subsequent conflicts largely unscathed, leaving it in a good position to profit when others are rebuilding their ravaged homes.","The famous Keziah arrogance is not entirely unwarranted, just misplaced. The planet's peace and prosperity can be credited to its successful diplomats and keen eye for when to switch sides in any given conflict.

It's known as neutral ground, and a haven for ships travelling though.","There are plenty of negotiations on Concord, and some of them might even be fair, but whoever loses, House Rathmund always seems to win.

Many new citizens trying to make it between the electric storms and corporate ravages have bitterly regretted their choice to move there.","The Blessing of Peace is the only planet with House Rathmund operating in the open.

Visiting these places as anything other than a pilgrim or a supplicant is almost impossible, as the Church makes sure outsiders rarely get a glimpse of what happens inside.","There's a reason why the Church doesn't want outsiders snooping around on Ascalon.
